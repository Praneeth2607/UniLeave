Student Leave & Permission Management System
Backend Service (MERN Stack)
Overview

This repository contains the backend implementation of the Student Leave & Permission Management System, a role-based web application designed to replace informal and handwritten leave processes in educational institutions.

The backend is responsible for authentication, role-based access control, leave request lifecycle management, approval workflows, reporting, and audit logging. It is built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, following standard software engineering principles such as separation of concerns, clear responsibility boundaries, and immutable state transitions.

Core Objectives

Enforce strict role-based access control

Provide a clean and traceable leave request lifecycle

Support faculty approval workflows

Enable department-level reporting and oversight

Maintain structured, auditable records suitable for analysis and documentation
